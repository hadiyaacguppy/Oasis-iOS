## Steps to use

  

  

Suppose your new project name is `MyApp`.

  

** Be sure not to include spaces or any special characters in the project name ** . App display name can be changed later to match any combination

  

  

1.  `git clone https://gitlab.com/tedmob/ios/base-project-swift.git MyApp`

  

  

2. Run `bash rename-project.command ` once the clone is done.

  

  

3. This will ask for the new name and a confirmation

  

  

4. Once rename is don, It will commit the new changes with a special commit message

  

  

5. Run `carthage update --platform iOS --no-use-binaries`

  <summary>Solution for Carthage failure on Xcode 12.0.1 mainly</summary>
  
  ## Workaround that works with both Xcode 11 and 12
  Works with all versions of Xcode 12 (except beta 1 and 2; but no-one should be using those anymore). Once XCFrameworks support lands in Carthage this workaround wonâ€™t be needed. However not that XCFrameworks puts some strict requirements on projects that most projects donâ€™t comply with.

Note: This is a change from before where the script excluded arm64 for simulators by individual Xcode 12 version. It now removes it from all Xcode 12 based builds.

How to use
Save the script (ðŸ‘‡) to your project (e.g. as a carthage.sh file).
Make the script executable chmod +x carthage.sh
Instead of calling carthage ... call ./carthage.sh ...
E.g. ./carthage.sh build or ./carthage.sh update --use-submodules
Script
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# carthage.sh
# Usage example: ./carthage.sh build --platform iOS

set -euo pipefail

xcconfig=$(mktemp /tmp/static.xcconfig.XXXXXX)
trap 'rm -f "$xcconfig"' INT TERM HUP EXIT

# For Xcode 12 make sure EXCLUDED_ARCHS is set to arm architectures otherwise
# the build will fail on lipo due to duplicate architectures.
echo 'EXCLUDED_ARCHS__EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_SUFFIX_simulator__NATIVE_ARCH_64_BIT_x86_64__XCODE_1200 = arm64 arm64e armv7 armv7s armv6 armv8' >> $xcconfig
echo 'EXCLUDED_ARCHS = $(inherited) $(EXCLUDED_ARCHS__EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_SUFFIX_$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_SUFFIX)__NATIVE_ARCH_64_BIT_$(NATIVE_ARCH_64_BIT)__XCODE_$(XCODE_VERSION_MAJOR))' >> $xcconfig

export XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE="$xcconfig"
carthage "$@"
```

6. Run `pod install --verbose`

  

  

7. Add your remote origin since git was reinitialized:
```
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:tedmob/MyApp.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master 
```






8. Open `MyApp.xcworkspace` and build


  
  

## Tests
